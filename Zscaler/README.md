# Zscaler AutoPkg Recipe

This recipe is forked from an initial idea by @williamtheaker on Github to use the release notes to figure out new versions of Zscaler.

You can set INCLUDE_LIMITED to true to try to include limited availability (aka beta) releases into the AutoPkg checks, but this has been mostly unreliable in my testing as the full verisons are not published to the public CMS.
